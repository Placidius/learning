                If I had to name one problem that plagues the modern learner more than previous generations, it is the embarassment of riches available to him. It has likely never been the case that a learner didn't have to prioritize what exactly was most important to learn, but today, the availability of information is the greatest ever. The learner must prioritize time learning above all of the distractions of modern life, but must also learn which learning should be prioritized and this can create a near paralysis. The potential learner must nurture focus and determination in the face of an onslaught of information. This is why I recommend a cleansing ritual in order to sanctify a space for learning and take oneself away from areas in which they have already developed pathways for distraction. One such method is to go low  tech. Use books and notes exclusively at first. When using technology, use the lowest tech solution that meets your needs(e.g. a scientific calculator or graphing calculator rather than a computer). When a computer must be used, dedicate a laptop or tablet as a clean instrument and commit that it will never be used for anything but learning.
